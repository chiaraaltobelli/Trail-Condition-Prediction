History:
So back in the 1980s, there was this Dutch person. He goes by the name Guido van Rossum. He worked at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science). It's also known as CWI. Please don't get this confused with the College of Western Idaho, because it is not the College of Western Idaho. While researching the computers at CWI, Guido was fed up with this computer programming language: ABC. This is because ABC was inflexible and couldn't handle conditions that were unusual Additionally, ABC didn't work directly with the operating system he was using. Python was a project that Guido was working on during the holidays. However, he decided to buckle down and finish it after the 1989 holiday. It took three months to come up with Python's first iteration. It took an additional year before others could utilize its practical applications. Over the years, Python 2 and Python 3 were developed, furthering Python's simplistic nature. One improvement worth noting is that Python 3 managed to remove many duplicate processes from earlier versions. In terms of Python's latest developments, (Microsoft) teams are working on making it faster.

During this time, the name "Python" came from one of Guido's favorite TV shows: Monty Python's Flying Circus. Just like the TV show, Python is closely related to the English language, accessible, and well-known. It was designed so that newcomers can easily pick up on the language syntax. Furthermore, Python supports object orientation, which works in similar ways to other OOP languages like Java. The main aspect of Python's syntax involves the use of the "self" parameter.
Here's an example:

class Fridge:
    degrees_F = 32

    def __init__(self, house_name, num_beers):
        self.house_name = house_name
        self.num_beers = num_beers

In this class, degrees_F is initialized to 32 for all Fridge objects upon initialization. The fields house_name and num_beers are set to the parameter values. In Java, it's common for "this" to be used when setting a field. One main difference is how you don't have to declare house_name and num_beers for this object. However, "self" is needed as a parameter if you want to access these values in other class functions:

class Fridge:
    degrees_F = 32

    def __init__(self, house_name, num_beers):
        self.house_name = house_name
        self.num_beers = num_beers

    def get_drunk(self):
        self.num_beers = 0
        return "Hey alkie! There are no beers left in the fridge; get Andre to buy you some more."

Another important characteristic is its dynamic typing. This means that a program's types are checked at run time. This also means that you can change a variable's type after it's initialized. This supports Python's goal of being flexible. Here's an example:

fav_num = "three"
fav_num = 3 # no error
if fav_num == 2:
    print(fav_num + "is two")# no error
print(fav_num + "is three")# error

Notice how I could change the type of fav_num from a string to an int. Also, the error on the last line will be caught at run time.


Libraries:
Meanwhile, Python was designed to be open source and free to use. This, along with its simple syntax, led to its usage among many different applications. One of the most popular applications is Machine Learning. Our objective is to explore the wide variety of libraries Python offers for various stages of the Machine Learning process. This includes tools for data preparation and visualization, with libraries like numpy for numerical operations, pandas for data structuring, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and scikit-learn for classic algorithms.


numpy is a popular library. A common usage for it is to perform array operations with ease. For example, if you wanted to add corresponding elements in two, same sized arrays together (add both elements at index 0, 1, etc.), this would normally require a for loop. However, this can be accomplished simply with numpy:

import numpy as np
a1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
a2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
result = a1 + a2

The result now has the vector sum of each array. Many other numerical operations exist in this library, which makes it easy to manipulate and change the data.


pandas is another popular library. You can easily use it to filter data and structure it the way you want. An example is if you only want to save a certain portion of the data:

import pandas as pd
drinks = pd.read_csv('drinks.csv')
drunk_drinks = drinks[drinks['Alcohol Content Percentage'] > 1]

In this example, let's say that drinks.csv is a dataset, and one of the columns is named Alcohol Content Percentage. Let's also say that each value is the exact percentage of alcohol in the drink. This code will create a two dimensional structure called a dataframe from the csv file (similar to a 2-D array). It will also create an additional dataframe that only contains row's that have an "Alcohol Content Percentage" greater than 1.


matplotlib and seaborn provide useful options for visualizations. Here's an example:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
data = {
    'beer_num': [1, 20, 5],
    'enjoyment_score': [1, 8, 6]
}
data = pd.DataFrame(data)
sns.scatterplot(x='beer_num', y='enjoyment_score', data=data)
plt.xlabel('Number of Beers')
plt.ylabel('Enjoyment Score (1-10)')
plt.title('Beers Consumed Verses Enjoyment')
plt.show()

OUTPUT:
![Scatter plot](visualexamplehistory.png)

As you can see, it's easy to use these libraries together to create a nice visual. The seaborn library creates
the scatter plot, and the matplotlib library creates nice graph labels. Python has many other ways to create
visualizations as well if this isn't what you fancy.


scikit-learn is a staple for machine learning libraries. It can train a machine learning model and predict an outcome given some data. Without diving too deep, here's a surface level example:

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
beers_drunk = [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]
enjoyment_level = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
model = LinearRegression().fit(beers_drunk, enjoyment_level)
predicted_level = model.predict([[6]]) # predicting what the y value is if x is 6
print(predicted_level[0])

In this example, we are trying to predict what the enjoyment_level would be if a person drinks 6 beers. It uses linear regression to do this, which uses a line of best fit that is closest to all of the overall data points. Whichever corresponding y value is on this line of best fit (in this example, for 6) will be the result. In this example, 3.3 gets printed on the console, which makes sense given the previous values.
