This section will include various general programs that help to exhibit how Python works. Examples include a
simple ’Hello World’ program and a program that exhibits Python’s scoping mechanisms. It may also include a
manipulation of a common data structure used in Python and later discuss Python’s build system and interpreter,
and common ways to run a Python program. To emphasize how Python programs run, we will exhibit different
examples of running a program and demonstrate which commands are used

There are several ways to run Python code via interpretation:
1. Make a program in the shell. Here's how:
![shellprog](shellprog.png)\
This is where you can write code on the fly, and have it run without an IDE or any additional steps. Pretty cool!
2. Run a Python script directly. Let's say we already have a file. Let's say example.py has the following content:\
a = 1\
b = 2\
print(a - b + a)\
Right on, let's run it from the console, all lines at once!\
![script](script.png)\
As you can see, it only shows the output. Good enough! And, in many cases, it beats having to rewrite each line of code you need.
3. In an IDE. IDLE is one example. It's a fairly lame IDE that comes with many Python installations. VS Code is cooler, so we'll show you that one, check it out!\
![vscode](vscode.png)\
See the highlighted triangle in to top right? Click that, and it runs your program. What's cool is that it'll display the result in a terminal, similar to the one you can use for step 2. All you have to do is either open the file directly (File-Open File... in the menu), or open the folder that the file is in (see the option below Open File). Then, you can edit the code directly if you please, or run it as is.

Now, we will show you some other example programs. Check out the history section if you want to see some more!

1. Hello World:
```
print("Hello World!")
```
This is easy enough to understand, hopefully. It prints hello world to the console. It's the easiest program you can make, and fits it with Python's simple nature.

2. Python scope example:
```
def a():
    x = 1
    def b():
        x = 2
        return x + 4
    return b
x = 3
c = a()
print(c() + x)
```
Hell yeah! Python has static scoping, which means that variable values are determined by position. When you use the def keyword, you are creating a function. Additionally, since you don't need to declare the type before a variable, you can set a function to equal a variable (c). When c is printed, you first go to the a function, where x is set to 1. Then, you go to b, where x = 2. Since we are in the scope of the b function, x equals 2, and 2 + 4 is returned. Then, you add x to it in the final print statement. In this "outer" scope, x = 3, so 9 will be printed (2 + 4 + 3).

3. Manipulate a common data structure (dictionary):
```
d = {"a": 0, "b": 2, "c": 3}
d["a"] = 1
d["d"] = 4
del d["d"]
print(d["b"])
for key in d:
    print(key)
for value in d.values():
    print(value)
for key, value in d.items():
    print(key, value)
```
The dictionary is similar to associative arrays in other languages with key value pairs. It's used quite often, and has flexible ways to access elements in the data structure. You an initialize an empty dictionary by putting left and right curly braces together: {}. In this example, we put key value pairs we wanted the dictionary to start out with. To set a value in the dictionary, you can put the key in the square brackets on the left, and the value on the right of the equals sign. You can also remove a key value pair with "del" as seen above. Also, you can access the value of a given key as such: dictionaryname[keyname]. For iterating over the dictionary, you can use one of the for loops above. The first for loop iterates over the keys and prints each one. The second for loop iterates over the values and prints each one. The third for loop iterates over the keys and values, and prints each key value pair.
