1. See if Python is already installed by typing "python" or "py" in a terminal. If you see "Python 3.x.x" (where each x is a number) with additional instructions, it's installed. If you don't see this, go to step 2. See this site for more information:https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download
2. Find your OS in the link above, and see specific instructions. In most cases, you will download the installer from this site: https://www.python.org/downloads/. If there is any option to "add to path" or "add environment variables", select it. If this is your first time installing such software, it's recommended to not try custom/offline installs. It's also recommended to install the latest Python 3 version, even if you have an earlier version already installed.
3. Use the same command from step 1 to see if it's installed. If not, try step 2 again.
4. It's important to note that you can technically start developing in your console. However, since this is probably your first time, we'll hook you up with an IDE (environment for coding) that will be easier to get started with. VS Code is sick, and a popular choice among Python developers. Download it by following the instructions here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
5. Next, install the Python extension for VS Code. The easiest way to install it is by clicking on the extensions badge, searching for Python, and installing the option that comes up: ![VS Code Python](vscodepython.png)
6. To install needed libraries, pip will get the job done. Pip is a package management system that makes it easy to install libraries. Follow the simple instructions here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/. One thing that might be confusing is the script you need to download. Some browsers require that you right click this link https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py, and select "Save As". After doing this, it should be cake from there. After running your OS's "get-pip.py" command, you can check if it works by simply typing "pip" in the console. Please do not install earlier versions of pip.
7. To install the actual libraries, you can use the users guides for each respective library. Fortunately, each pip command that installs the library is very simple in my humble opinion:
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install scikit-learn

Your command may vary based on your Python version. For alternate ways to install, reference the user guides. To check if your library is installed, create a new python script, and use an import statement in VS Code. Here's some visual instructions that'll show you how to do this for a library (you don't have to pick the Desktop, just pick any folder to check for installation):\
![new file](newfile.png)\
![desktop](desktop.png)\
![create](create.png)\
![name](name.png)\
![code](code.png)\
If you don't see any "problems" related to the import (or yellow squiggles under the import), you got it! If you swore you installed the package, but are getting a related problem, bring up the command palette with Ctrl-Shift-P (Shift-Command-P for Mac), and search for the following (it will require you selecting the version of Python you installed the library on):\
![cmd](cmd.png)\
![version](version.png)\
The reason this is a good way to check installations is because in most cases, this will be the environment you develop in. This environment gives you immediate feedback on whether your programs are able to run. If you are new to this, please spend extra time learning about the syntax of each library before messing around with it too much. At a minimum, you should know what a proper import statement looks like for each one.
