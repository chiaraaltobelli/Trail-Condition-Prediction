Python has a HUGE community with many different resources. This is only a small fraction of what's available. However, our team tried to select significant resources that are used by many people:

1. This link is for the (approved) official documentation. It includes all of the libraries outlined in the history section, and the documentation for Python 3. It's a good idea to go to these links first, as it will give you definitive answers on how to use something. The Python website has generalized information (not library specific) on the syntax/usage of Python:<br/>
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html<br/><br/>
By contrast, each library's site is specific to the library. For example, if you want to do mathematical operations, numpy is a good place to go. Each library's site also gives you background on the library. If you are unsure whether the library can help you accomplish something, the links below are a good place to start.<br/>
https://numpy.org/\
https://pandas.pydata.org/\
https://matplotlib.org/\
https://seaborn.pydata.org/\
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html
<br/><br/>
If you want to get a good idea on how to use each library, you can find it easily by starting with the links above. However, because we love you, we have given you the respective user guides from each one (easy reads compared to other sources of information):\
https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/index.html#user\
https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide\
https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html\
https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html\
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html
<br/><br/>
Additionally, there are tutorials/learning platforms on these sites that you might also find useful. They are also easy to find, but we love you, so we put them here:\
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html\
https://numpy.org/learn/\
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html\
https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index\
https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html (combined user guide and tutorial, same link as above)\
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html
<br/><br/>
Note: The user guides and the tutorials are similar, and you will see some overlap in terms of material. However, in general, user guides are documentation with some instructions, and tutorials are actual lessons (where you are shown how to do specific things).<br/><br/><br/>

2. The Python community has a lot of different forums to interact with other Python users. There's even in person meet ups! Here is the hub for the options from the official site:<br/>
https://www.python.org/community/
<br/><br/>
For example, there is a discord server that is dedicated to Python:<br/>
https://www.pythondiscord.com/
<br/><br/>
Upon joining the server, you get a bunch of options for channels. One of them is for asking questions:

<br/><br/>
This is only one example of the many places you can go to ask questions and be a part of this large community.<br/><br/><br/>

3. Not to sound like a broken record, but if you want to learn how do something specific, there are a LOT of different resources out there. For the remaining links, we tried to pick different websites for each. If you read the history section, you should remember that Microsoft has an interest in this language. Therefore, it is safe to assume that it has its own resources for getting familiar with Python. Python is known for scripting and automation (running automatic instructions), and Microsoft has a good resource for this:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/scripting<br/><br/><br/>

4. Machine learning is arguably the most important and well known application of Python. There are many places you could go to learn this specific craft. Real Python is one of these places. It has many great python tutorials, including machine learning:\
https://realpython.com/tutorials/machine-learning/<br/><br/><br/>

5. Python can also be used for web development. Specifically, if you have a web application that requires machine learning, Python is your best friend. Python also takes advantage of many different web frameworks, giving you a lot of options:\
[List of Python Frameworks](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks/)
<br/><br/>
One of the most popular and simple frameworks to use is Flask. It standardizes and simplifies syntax, and is best for building APIs (among other things):\

<br/><br/>
The article below outlines a good roadmap for web development (with a Flask emphasis). One thing I should point out in this roadmap is that it's extremely beneficial to learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as it's used in conjunction with Python. If web development is the route you want to go, JavaScript specifically will give you some great tools for your front end. The site itself is one of the many paid sites that provide ways to level up your Python skills:\
