Python
Language Type: imperative, dynamic, strongly typed
Scope: static scoping
Binding: dynamic binding
Wide variety of uses, especially in machine learning applications, but not known to specialize for one type of usage.

R
Language Type: imperative, dynamic, weakly typed
Scope: static scoping
Binding: static binding
Also used in machine learning, but specializes in visualizing statistics.
Biggest similarities with Python: machine learning relevance
Biggest differences: static binding/more narrow usage

JavaScript
Language Type: imperative, dynamic, weakly typed
Scope: static scoping
Binding: dynamic binding
Mainly used in web development, front and backend, with an emphasis in client side development; it could be used for machine learning.
Biggest similarities with Python: language features: scope, binding, and it's imperative, dynamic typing
Biggest differences: weak typing/client side development specialization

Java
Language Type: imperative, statically typed, strongly typed
Scope: static scoping
Binding: static binding
