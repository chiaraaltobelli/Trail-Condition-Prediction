## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to explore a new programming language and showcase it's abilities by creating a website. We selected Python for this project due to its popular application in the field of machine learning.

Our project focuses on predicting trail conditions in Boise based on historical weather and trail data. This involved utilizing APIs to gather weather data, which was then used to train a machine learning model capable of forecasting trail conditions. We chose this project to highlight some of Python's most notable features: its simplicity, readability, and its extensive library support.

The layout of our website is designed to not only demonstrate our project but also provide background and educational resources beneficial to developers new to Python. Our website includes the following sections:

### History
This section discusses the history of Python, its origins, and its development in the 1980s by Guido van Rossum, whose inspiration was drawn from the ABC language. A focal point of the discussion is Python’s user-friendly syntax, which facilitates simple code writing, and its traits as a dynamically typed language. In the field of Machine Learning, there are a wide variety of libraries Python offers for various stages of the process. This section explains how these tools streamline the process of creating and training models but also provide robust methods for evaluation and optimization.

### Get Started with Python
This section highlights materials that the Python language has to offer, such as the approved docs and various tutorials that can be used to achieve different things that the language has to offer, such as scripting tutorials and automation, machine learning workflows, and website development (Python Documentation).

This section also describes how to install Python, as well as efficient ways to download and start using its many libraries. Important factors include things like needed IDEs and common interfaces that can be downloaded in order to interact with Python and the frequently used libraries.

A few general programs are also included in this section to exhibit how Python works as well as an overview of related languages while comparing them in terms of language type, scope, and bindings. This section compares Python with the following languages in this fashion: R, JavaScript, and Java. Each of these languages have enough similarities to be considered related, all while having enough differences to compare with Python’s unique aspects.

### About
This section gives a basic overview of our project and explains the main components, including the weather APIs, the machine learning component, and the user interface.

## Project semester and year

Fall Semester, 2023

## Running the program
To run the example code on non-project tabs (tabs besides projectAPI.html), just follow the instructions as stated on the site. It will also require following previous steps (installing python, etc.), and then copying/pasting code into the environment you want to run it from.
